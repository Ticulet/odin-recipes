    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a really easy Pizza Dough recipe</p>
    <p>Perfect for a delicious dinner that doesn't require much effort</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature
            After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. 
            This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare Your Surface With Oil
            You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. 
            However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) 
            with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.
        </li>
        <li>Shape the Dough
            You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. 
            No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, 
            you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch thick. 
            If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.
